Game for "Life in space" themed LibGDX Game Jam 

Hi !

This will be my game for LibGDX Game Jam, which theme is "Life in space".

Hopefully it will be some sort of station/mining/resource simulation.

Pitch :
"In a distant future, mankind will be exploring the galaxy expanding its control sphere, to do so, jump gates need to be built. That's what you'll be doing"

Game goal :
"Manage your asteroid mining facility to build the jump gate and connect it to the Rez (The net of pre-existing jump gates), probably in the minimum amount of time/rounds"

Game play elements (depending on progression and time remaining):
-Send missions to the surrounding asteroids to scan needed resources.
-Gather basic resources to build advanced buildings.
-Build and maintain your community living and production facilities.
-Produce the advanced hardware pieces and build the Jump Gate.
-Some hazards may happen to your missions and station, secure (or not) your goods and human resources.

Dev tools :
-Overlap2d for UI (will try)
-Android studio.
-Possibly some Ashley.
-TiledMap

Gfx Tools :
-Tiled
-Paint.net
-If I have enough time, produce better assets with pre-rendered images with Blender.

Sound Tools:
-Audacity / Garage band for sounds.

Target platforms :
-Desktop
-Android (possibly)
-iOS (will try)
